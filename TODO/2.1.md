# TODO-list for version 2.1 (or is it 3.0 at this point?)

## Rework solver

### 1. Implement minimum viable

* Check current optimal implementation (implement command, this is not step)
* Save old pruning values in cubedata
* Implement branch switching
* Get rid of useless allocations, pass empty pointer and copy there

### 2. Rework achitecture and file dependencies

* solve.h depends only on moves(alg?) (dependency on step and trans is removed).
* Other modules have changed dependencies, might as well rework all.
* Make files smaller, do not include definition in .h, separate
data from abstract operations.
* remove cubetypes.h
* Create a module for multi-step (maybe wait?)
* Possible changes: in step solver, copy cube only if niss; add cleanup function
in solver (called by solve()) to free cube and perhaps pruning tables.
* see various TODO's in files

### 3. More threading options

* Lazy multithread: threads are as independent as possible and only
merged at the end. Ideal when all solutions of a certain length are requested.
* (Done) Eager multithread: current implementation, branches communicate the
number and list of solutions to stop as soon as possible. Good when only one
solution of a certain depth is required.

## Simplify steps

* Remove one type of rotation.
* Change steps to choicestep and stepalt to step (or was this already done?).
* Maybe: split optimal solver to a completely different module. This allows
  for good semplification on the main generic solver (e.g. get rid of
  move_check_stop). To be evaluated in terms of performance gain and actual
  simplification (might not be much for either).

## Add missing coordinates and steps

* Check the old file for a list. Many are missing.
* Checkers in steps.c should use coordinates.

## Missing and new commands

* gen
* freemem
* twophase

## Easy improvements

* Solve should re-orient the cube if centers are off
* Solve: add options for -I (inverse only) and -L (linear = normal + inverse).
